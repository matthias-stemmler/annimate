# ![Annimate logo](img/annimate-logo.png) Annimate<br>Your Friendly ANNIS Match Exporter

Annimate (for <u>ANNI</u>S <u>Mat</u>ch <u>E</u>xporter) is a tool for the convenient export of query results (matches) from the ANNIS[^1] system for linguistic corpora.

It is meant as a supplement to the ANNIS web interface and focuses on file export (as opposed to visualization) of the results of an ANNIS query.

> Annimate is being developed by [Matthias Stemmler](https://github.com/matthias-stemmler) in cooperation with the [Lehrstuhl fÃ¼r Deutsche Sprachwissenschaft](https://www.uni-augsburg.de/de/fakultaet/philhist/professuren/germanistik/deutsche-sprachwissenschaft/) at the University of Augsburg.
>
> It is based on the [graphANNIS](https://github.com/korpling/graphANNIS) library by Thomas Krause.

Annimate can currently produce a CSV or an Excel file with one row per match, showing the matched nodes in their context in a KWIC (Keyword in Context) format as well as additional annotations of the matched nodes and metadata on the corpus and document levels. It is similar in functionality to a combination of the ANNIS `TextColumnExporter` and `CSVExporter`, but provides a friendlier user interface.

This User Guide explains the details on how to work with Annimate.
