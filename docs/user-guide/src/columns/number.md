# Number

!["Number" column](../img/column-number.png)

This produces a single column that just contains the number of each match, i.e. it contains `1` for the first match, `2` for the second match and so on.

This can be useful for referring to specific matches when analyzing the exported data. When exporting to Excel, it is particularly useful because Excel's automatic row numbering counts the header row as row number 1 and the first match row as row number 2, while a "Number" column produced by Annimate starts with 1 for the first match. The number next to the last match is the total number of matches.
